# Storybook Agent Instructions

Keep this file, `AGENTS.md`, up to date when Storybook's architecture, tooling, workflows, or contributor guidance changes.

This file is the canonical instruction source for coding agents. Files like `CLAUDE.md` should point here instead of duplicating instructions.

## Repository Overview

Storybook is a large TypeScript monorepo. The git root is the repo root, the main code lives in `code/`, and build tooling lives in `scripts/`. The default branch is `next`.

- **Base branch**: `next` (all PRs should target `next`, not `main`)
- **Node.js**: `22.22.3` (see `.nvmrc`) — supports `.ts` natively via type stripping (no loader needed)
- **Package Manager**: Yarn Berry
- **Task orchestration**: NX plus the custom `yarn task` runner
- **Linting**: oxlint (root `.oxlintrc.json`, extended by `code/.oxlintrc.json` and `scripts/.oxlintrc.json`; custom rules load via `jsPlugins`). ESLint is no longer used for repo linting — `code/lib/eslint-plugin` remains as the published `eslint-plugin-storybook` package.
- **Formatting**: oxfmt (root `.oxfmtrc.json`)
- **CI environment**: Linux and Windows
- **TS execution**: Migrating from `jiti` to native `node` for running `.ts` files. New scripts should use `node ./path/file.ts` with explicit `.ts` import extensions (enabled by `allowImportingTsExtensions` in tsconfig). Legacy scripts still use `jiti` but should be migrated over time.
- **Type checking**: Per-package checks (`yarn task check`, `scripts/check/check-package.ts`) and Vitest type tests (`*.test-d.ts`) run on the TypeScript 7 native compiler (the `typescript-native` npm alias); check diagnostics are filtered to the checked package. A package that is not strict (Angular, Angular-Vite) can list files such as type tests in a `tsconfig.strict.json`; those are also checked with `strict: true`, counting only diagnostics in the listed files. `@storybook/vue3`, `@storybook/docgen-harness` (for its `.vue` fixtures), and `@storybook/svelte` use `vue-tsc` / `svelte-check` (TS 6 based). The workspace `typescript` dependency stays on TS 6 for IDEs and API consumers, so tsconfigs must remain valid for both (e.g. no `baseUrl`).

### Storybook 11 docgen feature contract

- `features.docgenServer` defaults to `true` for every React-renderer framework and the Angular and
  Vue 3 Vite frameworks, including React frameworks that use Webpack.
  Unsupported frameworks resolve it to `false`, even when it is explicitly `true`.
- Resolution order is the stable option, deprecated `experimentalDocgenServer`, Storybook 10
  legacy preservation, then the supported-framework default. The deprecated option and automatic
  legacy preservation expire in Storybook 12.
- With neither option explicit, preserve React `reactDocgen: false` and
  `'react-docgen-typescript'`, plus Vue `docgen: false` or `true`, explicit engines, and custom docgen
  `tsconfig` values, by disabling the server. Explicit `docgenServer: true` wins and warns that the
  legacy setting is ignored. Do not translate RDT options such as `propFilter` or a Vue docgen
  `tsconfig` automatically.
- Angular `compodoc: false` controls only the legacy Compodoc run. It is not a server opt-out.

## Common Commands

Run commands from the repository root unless stated otherwise.

For routine agent work, prefer the faster non-production commands first. Add `-c production` only when you need sandbox-related NX tasks or you are explicitly matching CI behavior.

### Install and compile

```bash
yarn
yarn task compile
yarn nx run-many -t compile
yarn nx compile <nx-project-name>
```

### Lint and typecheck

```bash
yarn lint
yarn --cwd code lint:js:cmd <file-relative-to-code-folder> --fix
yarn task check
yarn nx run-many -t check
```

### Development and tests

```bash
cd code && yarn storybook:ui
cd code && yarn storybook:ui:build
yarn test
yarn test:watch
yarn storybook:vitest
```

## Sandbox Notes

- If sandbox generation fails, fall back to `cd code && yarn storybook:ui`

## How To Work In This Repo

### For normal code changes

1. Install if needed: `yarn`
2. Compile with NX: `yarn nx run-many -t compile`
3. Make changes
4. Recompile affected packages
5. Validate there are no TypeScript errors with `yarn nx run-many -t check`
6. Run relevant lint and tests
7. Validate behavior in the internal Storybook UI first, then switch to sandbox or `-c production` flows only if you need template or CI parity

### For addon, framework, or renderer work

1. Edit the relevant package under `code/addons/`, `code/frameworks/`, or `code/renderers/`
2. Recompile with NX, starting without `-c production`
3. Generate a matching sandbox
4. Run the relevant Vitest, E2E, or Storybook UI validation flow

## Pull Request Requirements

The `Danger` status check validates PR metadata, not the diff.
It reads only the title, body, labels, and reviews, and it executes `scripts/dangerfile.ts` from the base branch, so nothing committed inside a PR can change that PR's own Danger result.
Reproduce it locally against a real PR with `DANGER_GITHUB_API_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)" node_modules/.bin/danger pr <pr-url> --dangerfile scripts/dangerfile.ts`.

- **Title** must match `Area: Summary`, with both parts starting with a capital letter, for example `CSF: Add conservative story mutation API`. Conventional-commit titles such as `fix(csf-tools): add ...` fail the check, even though commit messages in this repo do use that form.
- **Body** must contain a `#### Manual testing` heading followed by steps a maintainer can follow. The check bypasses `OWNER` and `MEMBER` authors, but private org membership resolves to `CONTRIBUTOR` for the CI token, so write the section even when you are a member.
- **For non-release PRs targeting `next`, labels** must satisfy the exactly-one rules in [`scripts/dangerfile.ts`](scripts/dangerfile.ts). The valid change types come from the `pr-log` configuration in [`code/package.json`](code/package.json); the `ci:` and `qa:` label sets are defined in the dangerfile. Check those sources instead of copying their current values into agent guidance. The dangerfile also defines the separate release-PR rule. `other` is listed in the PR template but is not a valid change type for Danger, and `BREAKING CHANGE` is rejected while the dangerfile pins the branch version to minor.
- **Review** must include an approving review from the `core` or `developer-experience` team. The author's own approval is ignored, so this one clears only once a human on those teams approves.

## Testing Expectations

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **For React components, write Storybook stories with `play` functions — do NOT write `*.test.tsx` unit tests.** Behavior, accessibility, and interaction assertions belong in `*.stories.tsx` co-located with the component, executed via the Storybook Vitest project (`yarn storybook:vitest` or `vitest run --config code/vitest.config.storybook.ts`). Unit tests (`*.test.ts(x)`) are reserved for pure utilities, hooks, and non-React modules where rendering is not involved.

- Use `yarn storybook:vitest` to run Storybook story tests (the primary test path for components)
- Use `yarn test` for unit tests of utilities, hooks, and non-React modules
- Prefer focused unit-test runs during iteration — the full suite is large: `yarn test <pattern>` (e.g. `yarn test csf-tools`)
- Use Storybook UI or Chromatic for visual validation
- Use `yarn task e2e-tests --start-from auto` or `yarn task e2e-tests-dev --start-from auto` for E2E coverage
- Use `yarn task smoke-test --start-from auto` for smoke checks
- Use `cd code && yarn playwright test -c e2e-internal/playwright.config.ts e2e-internal/tools-attach.spec.ts` for tools attach coverage (same checkout as the running internal UI)

## Quality and Logging

After changing files:

1. **Always** format with `yarn fmt:write`, run from the `code/` directory (`cd code && yarn fmt:write`), once you are done editing. The repo uses `oxfmt`, so hand-written formatting will frequently be wrong — do not skip this step.
2. Lint with `yarn --cwd code lint:js:cmd <file-relative-to-code-folder> --fix` or `cd code && yarn lint:js:cmd <file-relative-to-code-folder>`
3. Run relevant tests before submitting a PR

Use Storybook loggers instead of raw `console.*` in normal code paths:

- Server-side: `storybook/internal/node-logger`
- Client-side: `storybook/internal/client-logger`

For TypeScript source in the repo, prefer explicit file extensions for relative code imports and exports such as `./foo.ts` or `./bar.tsx` when the target is another TS/JS module in this repository. Keep framework-specific component imports like `.vue` and `.svelte` in the form already expected by their package tooling.

The pre-commit hook automatically detects AI agents (via `std-env`) and switches from check-only to write mode, so formatting is auto-fixed when agents commit.

Avoid `console.log`, `console.warn`, and `console.error` unless the file is isolated enough that importing the logger is not reasonable.

## Troubleshooting

- Build failures are often fixed by rerunning `yarn` and `yarn nx run-many -t compile`
- Storybook UI uses port `6006` by default
- Large compiles may require more Node.js memory
- Sandbox paths are `../storybook-sandboxes/`, not `./sandbox` or `code/sandbox/`
- Use `--debug` for verbose CLI output
- Check generated sandbox directories and `.cache/` for build artifacts

## Canary Releases

When you need a pkg.pr.new canary, follow [`.agents/skills/canary/SKILL.md`](.agents/skills/canary/SKILL.md) and [`CONTRIBUTING/RELEASING.md`](CONTRIBUTING/RELEASING.md).

## Commands To Avoid

- **DO NOT RUN** `yarn task dev` without an explicit sandbox template
- **DO NOT RUN** `yarn start`

These usually start long-running development servers and are the wrong default for agents.

## Automigrations

- Read `code/lib/cli-storybook/src/automigrate/README.md` before adding or changing an automigration.

## Repository skills

- Canonical contributor skills live in `.agents/skills/`; `.claude/skills/` contains references to them.
- Use [principle-encode-lessons-in-structure](.agents/skills/principle-encode-lessons-in-structure/SKILL.md) to turn recurring corrections into enforceable checks.

## Code Authoring Principles

These are recurring failure modes in agent-authored changes to this repo. Apply them when writing or reviewing code, not just when asked.

- **Write comments only for the two reasons in [Comments and JSDoc](#comments-and-jsdoc).** That section is the rule; this list does not restate it.
- **Verify environment assumptions empirically before encoding them.** If a design rests on "the bundler strips X" or "this metadata is empty here", prove it with a throwaway probe before building on it (and before writing it into a comment as fact). A 10-line experiment is cheaper than a wrong architecture.
- **Encode assumptions with static checks first.** If an assumption is expected to always hold, prefer making it impossible via TypeScript types and existing lint rules. When static checks are not practical, add a cheap runtime assertion close to the boundary so violations fail loudly at the source.
- **Avoid redundant tests already covered elsewhere.** Do not add tests for code patterns already guaranteed by TypeScript or linting, and do not duplicate coverage that already exists in Storybook `play` functions or Playwright tests.
- **Test contracts (including side effects), not private implementation details.** It is valid to assert side effects when they are part of the public contract. Avoid assertions about internals that are not part of an exported contract, user-visible DOM output, or externally observable behavior.
- **Bias toward broader coverage for security and migrations.** For security-sensitive code paths and legacy data migration logic, prefer handling more edge cases and documenting evidence for the chosen safeguards. Migration compatibility code should be explicitly version-scoped so it can be removed once the support window ends.
- **Prefer deletion and simplicity over speculative generality.** No abstraction, fallback, or "flexibility" for a consumer or scenario that does not exist in this codebase today. If a change adds many lines, check whether the right change removes them.
- **Don't commit accidental overrides to generated code.** Files like `code/core/src/manager/globals/exports.ts` are auto-generated, as stated in their JSDoc header. Only commit changes if they match changes you made on your PR, otherwise leave them untouched and flag flaky generated files in the PR description.

## Comments and JSDoc

Code should be self-explanatory. A comment is only justified when the code cannot explain itself (a non-obvious _why_) or when a public API needs explanation. Never comment to record that you did x, y, z.

Before writing or editing any code file, read [`.agents/guidelines/comments-and-jsdoc.md`](.agents/guidelines/comments-and-jsdoc.md) and follow it. Read it once per session, not once per file.

## Maintenance Rules For Agents

- `AGENTS.md` owns the kickstart: identity, base rules, common commands,
  guardrails, and the pointers below. Keep it lean; push detail into the
  linked documents instead of inlining it.
- Each linked document is canonical for its topic. Update that document, not
  this file, when its topic changes. If a topic disappears, remove the
  document and its pointer together.
- Keep `CLAUDE.md` and other agent entrypoints as thin references to
  `AGENTS.md`.
- `.github/workflows/claude.yml` `--disallowed-tools` mirrors the Commands To
  Avoid section; update both together.
- Do not reintroduce duplicated instruction files when a reference will do.

## Deep dives

Read these when the task calls for them, not by default. Each document is
canonical for its topic; this file owns the pointers.

- [Architecture and repository structure](.agents/guidelines/architecture.md) — read before
  touching `code/core` internals, presets, open services, or the tools CLI.
- [NX and `yarn task`](.agents/guidelines/nx-and-yarn-task.md) — read before sandbox, E2E, or
  CI-parity work. Includes the environment variable reference.
- [Sandboxes](.agents/guidelines/sandboxes.md) — read before generating or debugging a sandbox.
- [Testing](.agents/guidelines/testing.md) — read before writing or running tests beyond the
  commands above; covers memfs filesystem tests and global stubbing rules.

## Learned User Preferences

- Prefer git worktrees for parallel or experimental work; keep the primary workspace clean and base feature branches on `origin/next`, not a dirty local `next`.
- Prefer simplicity: avoid premature helpers and one-off abstractions; implement small logic inline when a shared helper is not clearly reused.
- Keep e2e and long interaction tests as a readable continuous flow; do not force DRY with loops or heavy helpers when repetition is clearer.
- For Storybook stories, put human-facing description in JSDoc above the `meta` const rather than a `description` parameter.
- When renaming tools or APIs that emit telemetry, keep historical telemetry string names stable across Storybook versions unless the field is brand-new and has no existing data.
