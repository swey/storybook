# Architecture

This document is canonical for repo structure and architecture: renderer vs builder vs framework, the core package layout, key flows, open services and toolsets, and agent-facing skills. `AGENTS.md` owns the pointer to this file and the kickstart commands.

## Renderer vs builder vs framework

| Concept   | Role                                  | Example                   |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Renderer  | Mounts UI framework to the DOM        | `@storybook/react`        |
| Builder   | Bundles and serves Storybook          | `@storybook/builder-vite` |
| Framework | Renderer + builder + framework config | `@storybook/react-vite`   |

## Core package

The main package is `code/core/src/`. The most important areas are:

- `core-server/` for dev server, static build, and presets
- `manager/` and `manager-api/` for the Storybook UI
- `preview/` and `preview-api/` for story rendering
- `channels/` for manager <-> preview communication
- `csf-tools/` for AST-based story indexing
- `common/` for shared Node.js utilities
- `test/` and `instrumenter/` for testing support

Public exports include:

- `storybook/actions`
- `storybook/preview-api`
- `storybook/manager-api`
- `storybook/theming`
- `storybook/test`

Internal exports include:

- `storybook/internal/core-server`
- `storybook/internal/csf-tools`
- `storybook/internal/common`
- `storybook/internal/channels`
- `storybook/internal/tools` — Node SDK for `storybook tools` (`createTools`)

## Key flow

- `.storybook/main.ts` is loaded at startup
- `.storybook/preview.ts` is bundled into preview (TSX for React-based frameworks)
- `.storybook/manager.ts` is bundled into manager
- `*.stories.*` files are indexed by AST before runtime
- Story selection loads the module, prepares the story, and renders it

AST indexing keeps the sidebar fast and prevents one broken story file from breaking the whole UI.

For AST mutations, use `CsfFile.objects()` for stories and `ConfigFile` directly for preview or main
configuration. Both expose `get`, `getValue`, `set`, `transform`, `remove`, `rename`, `move`, and `group`, with automatic
empty-parent cleanup. `set` accepts AST expressions and plain values, including nested arrays and objects.
`getValue` reads plain values statically; unresolved expressions produce diagnostics without executing code.
Use the file's `changed` and `mutationDiagnostics` to decide whether to write
the result. Named variable and function exports in config files share one logical root for these operations.
Use `ConfigFile.callArguments()` for object arguments to imported method calls such as
`addons.setConfig(...)`. Use `group(path, names)` when nesting sibling fields must preserve expression
evaluation order. Keep AST discovery, mutation, and safety checks in `csf-tools`; automigrations declare
the fields to change and provide migration-specific error guidance.

## Open services and toolsets

- Open services own internal state, synchronization, queries, commands, and loading. Toolsets expose
  capabilities to agents through MCP and the `storybook tools` CLI.
- Definitions live under `code/core/src/shared/open-service/`; addons may own and register their own
  toolsets, as addon-vitest does for `test`.
- Register services and toolsets from the same `services` preset hook and behind the same feature
  gate. Missing or duplicate registrations fail loudly.
- The tools CLI consumes `storybook/internal/tools` (`createTools`). Default mode is
  attach-preferred (`auto`): join a running instance as a delegated leaf, or load locally on gate
  failure. `--attach` requires attachment; `--no-attach` forces local. When several running
  instances match the project, attach picks the invoking agent's most recently started one and
  warns on stderr; `-p, --port` targets a specific instance. Local `createTools` never
  `chdir`s: a foreign `cwd` starts a project-local child host.
- Read `code/core/src/shared/open-service/README.md` before changing the contract, adapters,
  registration, docs access, or transport rendering. Read `code/core/src/cli/tools/README.md` and
  `code/core/src/cli/tools/architecture.md` before changing attachment, the SDK, or the tools CLI.

### Docgen server

- `features.docgenServer` defaults to `true` when any loaded preset exports `experimental_docgenProvider`, and the main config overrides it.
  Today that is the React and Vue 3 renderer presets and `@storybook/angular-vite`.
- Ship a provider by exporting `experimental_docgenProvider` from a preset; do not add framework defaults or allowlists.
  A provider must not read `features.docgenServer`: only consumers gate on it.
- Svelte and Web Components keep their providers unexported until they ship.
- Legacy React and Vue extractor settings are preserved only by the `docgen-server` automigration, which writes `docgenServer: false`.
  Angular `compodoc: false` controls only the legacy Compodoc run and is not a server opt-out.

## Agent-facing skills

- `storybook skills` serves the `stories`, `write-story`, and `setup` documents as Markdown.
- Pure content lives in `code/core/src/cli/skills/content/` and is exported through
  `storybook/internal/skills`; addon-mcp consumes the same builders.
- Keep `cli/skills/**` independent of `cli/ai/**`, and keep `cli/skills/content/**` independent of
  `core-server`. Lint rules enforce both boundaries.
