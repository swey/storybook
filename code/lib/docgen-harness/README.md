# @storybook/docgen-harness

A private test harness for the "docgen beyond React" work.
It records what the legacy docgen pipelines produce today - extracted argTypes and generated code snippets - as reviewed snapshots, and holds the upcoming OSA engines to "current or better" against them.
Nothing here ships to npm.

## How to use it

```bash
yarn test code/lib/docgen-harness      # from the repo root
yarn test code/lib/docgen-harness -u   # re-record after an intentional change, then review the diff
```

Each framework has three test files:

- `*-baselines.test.ts` records argTypes and snippets per fixture and self-compares every committed baseline through the comparator.
- `*-osa-baselines.test.ts` records the server-side docgen provider output where that framework has one.
- `*-legacy-gaps.test.ts` pins known legacy defects as `test.fails` red markers. They turn into hard requirements once `baseline-path.ts` flips from `'legacy'` to `'osa'`.
- `*-render.test.ts` smoke-mounts the fixtures.

vue3 has a second recorder, `vue3-component-meta-baselines.test.ts`, because Vue ships two production docgen engines.
It drives the opt-in `vue-component-meta` path (`docgen: 'vue-component-meta'` in vue3-vite) over the same fixtures and writes `cm-`-prefixed snapshots.

## The comparator

`expectCurrentOrBetter` fails when a candidate loses anything a committed baseline records, and passes improvements.

- argTypes: every baseline key, description, default value, and type must survive.
  A type may only change by normalized deep equality or a clear improvement - a catch-all becoming structured, a literal union gaining members.
  About half the corpus records `other`, where the legacy engine parked free text it could not resolve (`TreeNode`, `Array([object Object])`, `{ theme: string; dense: boolean }`).
  Such a stub accepts a candidate that adds populated structure (an empty enum/union/object is not an improvement) or resolves it to the scalar or single literal it already named; an unrelated scalar or literal is a lateral change and fails.
  The markers that record nothing at all accept any candidate: `empty-enum`, `undefined`, and the empty string from today's Angular and Vue spellings, plus Web Components records with an undefined sbType `name` or a structural sbType `name` without a `value`.
  The legacy Web Components extractor records manifest type text as the sbType `name`, so an unknown name is read as `{ name: 'other', value: <text> }` and compared by the same stub-resolution rule.
  Under `legacyManifestRuntime`, scalar text requires the same scalar and literal-union text requires an enum that keeps every member.
  Same-named matches also require the same category, so a lost attribute is not rescued by a same-named slot.
  A resolution the rule cannot recognize (legacy `TSFunctionType` becoming a `function` sbType, say) fails rather than guessing; re-record and review the diff.
  A recorded `table.type.summary` must survive (dropping it is a violation), but its text may change freely outside `strictTable`.
  `required`, `table.category`, `jsDocTags`, `control`/`action`, and description/default contents are deliberately not compared (except `required` under `strictTable`); each would lock in a recorded lie (#28706) or engine-specific vocabulary.
- Snippets: represented binding names are compared as sets, so formatting can never fail, but a lost binding does.
  Directive spelling is normalized, so `:x`/`v-bind:x`, `@x`/`v-on:x`, `#x`/`v-slot:x`, and any `.modifier` all read as the same name.
  The Angular comparison additionally gates root-element identity: the tag name must match and bare (valueless) attributes - the mangled attribute-selector markers - must survive.
  The Web Components comparison reads plain HTML root snippets: represented names are root attribute names lowercased as written, and the structure gate requires root tag identity plus survival of bare attributes.
  The Svelte comparison parses only the PascalCase root component tag; its attribute scanner is brace-aware so values like `onclick={() => {}}`, object literals, arrays, and expressions containing `>` do not leak into attribute names.
  Svelte represented names are the root component's attribute names, including shorthand `{name}` as `name`; `{...args}` is ignored because recorded snippets should already be substituted.
- Acceptance: there is no allowlist file.
  The committed baseline is the allowlist - accept an intentional change by re-recording with `-u` and reviewing the diff.
- The recorders read each committed file and run every gate BEFORE the snapshot call, so a `-u` run refuses to queue a regressed recording and stays red until the code is fixed.
  Regressions fail with named violations; improvements pass.
- The committed `argtypes*.snapshot` files are pretty-format text, not JSON.
  `parseArgTypesSnapshot` reads them back, verifies itself by re-serializing every parse byte-for-byte, and rejects any parsed string carrying the writer-ambiguous entry-boundary shape.
  A string whose unescaped write is byte-identical to real entry boundaries cannot be detected at parse time; the recorders' parsed-vs-live proofs guard that case on normal and CI runs, and on `-u` runs against the exact bytes queued for writing.
- Adding a framework: extend the `Framework` union and compilation fails at the switch in `snippets.ts` until the new matcher exists.

### Trust model

The comparator machine-checks a deliberate subset: baseline arg names, description presence, default presence, `table.type.summary` presence, and type fidelity for argTypes; represented binding names, root-element identity, and bare-attribute survival for Angular snippets.
Everything else - description/default/summary text, `table.category`, `control`/`action`, per-arg `jsDocTags`, added args - is caught only by the byte-exact snapshot diffs reviewed at `-u` time, or by the sandbox gate's `change` findings.
Two flags scope trust to where the baseline earns it: `legacyBaseline` (only on legs whose baseline is a legacy compodoc recording) waives the raw `false`/`NaN`/`null` defaults that pipeline invents, and `strictTable` (only on the ACM self-ratchet, whose baseline the same engine recorded) additionally gates `table.type.summary` text changes and `table.type.required` true->false flips.
The web-components OSA recorder is the only user of `legacyManifestRuntime`, which waives legacy runtime re-keying and unresolved `void` event types.
The same recorder is the only user of `waivedArgs`, which accepts losing manifest-hidden members such as private, protected, or static class members.
The sandbox baseline gate runs in the daily CI tier, so a whole-project regression can merge green and surface up to a day later, detached from the offending PR.
Known-accepted blind spots: enum members whose quoted and bare spellings collide normalize to the same member (`'"small"'` reads as `small`), and `\r`/`\r\n` in extracted strings are LF-normalized by vitest at write time, so a CR-bearing extraction can never record green (perma-loud, never silent).

## The vue-component-meta recorder (vue3)

`vue3-component-meta-baselines.test.ts` replicates the vue3-vite vite plugin's meta processing exactly - checker options, empty-meta skip, nested-schema pruning, exposed de-duplication, and the vue-docgen-api event-description backfill - so the `cm-` snapshots show what a `vue-component-meta` user actually gets today.
Keeping that copy in step with `frameworks/vue3-vite/src/plugins/vue-component-meta.ts` is manual; nothing detects drift.

- The `cm-` prefix keeps each recorder's stale-snippet guard scoped to its own files.
- `sourceFiles` records `<sfc>` because production stores the absolute module id and snapshots must stay path-free; nothing downstream reads it.
- Like the legacy recorder, it self-compares every committed baseline through the comparator, so a checker or plugin change that loses extraction quality fails with named violations instead of landing as an unremarkable diff.
  Whether the OSA Vue engine is also held to these baselines - rather than only to the legacy ones - is a separate, later decision.
- Plugin and checker changes land here as reviewed snapshot diffs instead of silent drift - #35565 (`schema: true`) moved 17 of the 25 `cm-argtypes.snapshot` files and left every `cm-snippet-*` byte-identical.
  The recorded state is whatever the lockfile resolves `vue-component-meta` to (3.3.9 today), so a dependency bump is a reviewed baseline change too.

## Adding a fixture

One directory per case; the recorders discover it automatically.
The first run of a brand-new fixture fails once (snapshot files flush at suite end) - run it again and commit.
Record thin or wrong legacy output as-is; never "improve" a fixture to make the legacy result look better.
Snapshots must stay deterministic: no timestamps, no absolute paths.

- vue3: one PascalCase SFC (the filename becomes the component tag in every snippet) plus `input.stories.ts`.
- angular: one kebab-case `<case>.component.ts` (the class name must match the compodoc capture exactly) plus `input.stories.ts` and a captured `compodoc-input.json`.
  Signal fixtures also commit an `aot-cmp.ts` with the `ɵcmp` input/output maps, captured once from real `ngc` output - JIT leaves them empty.
  Stories import their CSF types from `src/angular/csf-types.ts`; the two runtime test files are excluded from the vue-tsc program because angular-vite client source is not strict-clean.
- svelte: one component plus `input.stories.svelte`; add supporting component/type files and `input.stories.ts` when the plain CSF snippet path is relevant.
  `input.stories.ts` imports `Meta`/`StoryObj` from `@storybook/svelte`.
  New fixtures need two focused Svelte test runs: the first creates `toMatchFileSnapshot` files at suite end, and the second proves the stale-file checks and comparator gates.
- web-components: one component source plus `input.stories.ts` and `custom-elements.json`.
  Lit TypeScript fixtures include a per-case `tsconfig.json` with decorator settings; vanilla fixtures are plain `.js` and do not need one.
  Every story file keeps the default export's `component` as the target tag name string.
  Optional hand-written 2.1.0, WCA and unflattened manifests live next to the capture and record under a prefix, except the server argTypes of an unflattened manifest, which must equal the capture's; snippets are not re-recorded for variants because the runtime snippet path does not read the manifest.

### Svelte story formats

The Svelte harness records two snippet paths because Storybook currently has two production sources:

- `snippet-<Story>.snapshot` is produced from `input.stories.svelte` by the published `@storybook/addon-svelte-csf` package pinned in devDependencies (5.1.2).
  The recorder mounts the composed story and captures the `SNIPPET_RENDERED` channel event emitted by the addon's runtime.
- `plain-csf-snippet-<Story>.snapshot` is produced from optional `input.stories.ts` files by the Svelte renderer's legacy `generateSvelteSource(component, args, argTypes, null)` path.
`story-descriptions.snapshot` records the docs description parameters that addon-svelte-csf creates from JSDoc above `defineMeta` and HTML comments above `<Story>`.

`svelte-osa-baselines.test.ts` drives the `@storybook/svelte` docgen provider directly in Node, with index entries built by the addon's own indexer from `input.stories.svelte`.
It records `osa-argtypes.snapshot`, `osa-payload.snapshot`, and `osa-description.snapshot` even while the provider returns nothing, so each provider PR shows its progress as a snapshot diff; `osa-argtypes.snapshot` is ratcheted against its own previous recording.
Parity with the legacy `argtypes.snapshot` is a per-fixture `it.fails` red marker in the same file: when one turns red, add the fixture to `LEGACY_PARITY`, which makes the legacy comparison a hard requirement for it.

### Capturing compodoc input (angular)

Captures are pinned to `@compodoc/compodoc@2.0.0`.
Re-capturing with any other version is a reviewed baseline change - signal parsing drifts hard across versions.
Compodoc scans everything under the nearest `package.json` and ignores tsconfig `include`, so capture from a staging directory outside any Node package:

1. Copy the component and its supporting sources (never `input.stories.ts`) plus the case `tsconfig.json` into an empty directory, e.g. `$(mktemp -d)`.
2. Run `npx -y @compodoc/compodoc@2.0.0 -p tsconfig.json -e json -d .` there.
3. Move the emitted `documentation.json` back as `compodoc-input.json`.
4. Run `cd code && yarn fmt:write`.

Nothing detects drift between a fixture's sources and its committed capture, so editing a component always means re-capturing in the same change.

### Capturing the manifest (web-components)

Captures are pinned to `@custom-elements-manifest/analyzer@0.11.0`.
Re-capturing with any other version is a reviewed baseline change.

From an empty staging directory, copy only the component source files - never `input.stories.ts`, never the fixture `tsconfig.json` - then run:

```bash
npx -y @custom-elements-manifest/analyzer@0.11.0 analyze --litelement
```

Drop `--litelement` for vanilla cases.
Use `--fast` when capturing `fast-attributes` and `--stencil` when capturing `stencil-props`; copy `.tsx` component sources into the staging directory too.
Move the emitted `custom-elements.json` back into the fixture directory and make sure `modules[].path` records relative file names only.

### Manifest shape variants (web-components)

The default capture stays at CEM 1.0.0 because the analyzer still writes that version.
The 2.1.0 variant is the same capture plus additive fields (`cssStates`, `readonly`), so a diff between `argtypes.snapshot` and `v2-argtypes.snapshot` shows exactly what a newer manifest buys.
The WCA variant records the deprecated web-component-analyzer shape that the runtime still accepts.
`lit-toolkit-shapes/custom-elements.json` additionally carries a hand-added `parsedType` on the `size` member, mirroring the wc-toolkit type-parser plugin output the OSA mapper reads for alias unions.
The `stencil-props` capture shows that analyzer 0.11.0 emits attributes for Stencil `@Prop` fields without type annotations without adding `type`, does not read the Stencil `reflect` option as `reflects` or `attribute` on the member, and keeps Stencil `render` as a method. The `fast-attributes` capture shows that FAST `@attr({ mode: 'boolean' })` carries no boolean marker beyond the field type, and FAST events appear only through class-level `@fires`.

### Server-side recorder (web-components)

`web-components-osa-baselines.test.ts` drives the `@storybook/web-components` docgen provider directly in Node. It parses each fixture story file through `loadCsf`, points the provider at the fixture's `custom-elements.json`, and records `osa-argtypes.snapshot`, `osa-description.snapshot`, and `osa-payload.snapshot`; the CEM 2.1.0 variant records `osa-v2-argtypes.snapshot` and `osa-v2-payload.snapshot`.
`web-components-baselines.test.ts` also runs the renderer's default `render` with the docgen-server flag on for every story without a custom render, and records `osa-snippet-<story>.snapshot`, gated current-or-better against the legacy `snippet-<story>.snapshot`.
The server recorder records CEM inputs only; the WCA shape is covered by the runtime recorder and rejected on the server path by the renderer's unit tests.
The `osa-argtypes.snapshot` and `osa-v2-argtypes.snapshot` files are gated against the committed legacy `argtypes.snapshot` and `v2-argtypes.snapshot` files, while `osa-payload.snapshot` and `osa-v2-payload.snapshot` keep the raw declaration slice, summary, renderer, and any error reviewable without duplicating argTypes.
The server mapper keys events, methods, slots, CSS parts and CSS states as `<name>-event`, `<name>-method`, `<name|default>-slot`, `<name>-part` and `<name>-state`, so they never collide with attributes.
It keeps the legacy `on<Name>` action twins, and the legacy gate matches re-keyed rows by `name`.
`OSA_CLOSED` in `web-components-legacy-gaps.test.ts` is the server-side progress ledger: move a marker there when an OSA mapper fix closes it.
The OSA recordings self-ratchet against themselves. When the server mapper changes shape on purpose (dropping members, re-keying args), delete the affected `osa-*argtypes.snapshot` files and re-record; `-u` cannot pass the self-ratchet.
The `legacyManifestRuntime` and `waivedArgs` waivers apply to the legacy gate only.
The OSA payload may carry `warning` when a manifest fails to reload and the worker serves its last valid version; `lit-schema-warning` keeps a member without `kind` to show that a manifest with schema deviations still loads, without a warning. To reproduce a reload locally, enable the feature flag, edit the manifest while the dev server runs and open or reload a docs page; the worker re-reads a manifest whose mtime changed and logs it at debug level.

## Known legacy gaps (vue3)

- Accepted delta: OSA snippets are static, so live Controls updates do not re-render them.
- Snippets never render event handlers; function args are silently dropped.
- `table.jsDocTags` stays `undefined`; component-level docblocks are not captured in script-setup SFCs.
- Literal-string unions never become an `enum` sbType, and the values keep their quote characters.
- Array- and intersection-typed props record the stringified `convert()` fallback (`Array([object Object])`).
- Reactive-props-destructure defaults are invisible; only `withDefaults()` is extracted.
- `defineModel('name')` named models are invisible; snippets render a bare attribute instead of `v-model:name`.
- Scoped-slot binding types are never extracted, only their names.
- `defineExpose` members record no type at all - name and description only, where `vue-component-meta` resolves the same members to `number` and `() => void`.
- Bigints beyond `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` lose precision in snippets.
- Thin baselines by design: `Pick`-composed props record `{}`, recursive types a name-only stub, runtime array props `type: undefined`.
- `defineProps<ReturnType<typeof useComposable>>()` does not build in the legacy toolchain; a statement-block event expression crashes `parse()` outright (#23851). No baselines can exist for either.

## Issue-linked cases (vue3)

Fixtures reproducing open GitHub issues, to verify and close them when the OSA Vue engine lands.
Each has a red marker in `vue3-legacy-gaps.test.ts`.

- #11774, #12331 -> `cross-file-runtime-props/`: imported runtime props must resolve to real argTypes (legacy records `{}`).
- #12331, #22187 -> `cross-file-props-spread/`: props spread from an imported call must be extracted.
- #12850, #23470 -> `prop-slot-name-collision/`: a prop must render as a prop attribute even when a slot shares its name.
- #19394 -> `runtime-multi-constructor/`: `type: [String, Number]` must become a structured union.
- #20593 -> `runtime-proptype-cast/`: literal unions behind `PropType` casts must keep their options.
- #24270 (partial) -> `define-slots-literal-bindings/`: `defineSlots` literal binding types must be extracted; the issue's own snippet repro is not covered here.
- #26465 (partial) -> `slots/`: scoped-slot binding types must be extracted; the marker covers only this symptom, not the issue's `vue-component-meta` repro.
- #26465 (not reproduced) -> `define-slots-with-props/`: the issue's own repro - documented `withDefaults` props plus `defineSlots` losing all prop meta under `vue-component-meta` - does not occur at 3.3.9.
  `cm-argtypes.snapshot` records descriptions, defaults, and slot docs fully intact; a regression baseline, no marker.
  The issue's secondary HMR symptom is dev-server behavior outside this harness's reach.
- #29354 -> `cross-file-union-alias/`: imported literal-union aliases must unfold to their options.
- #30045 -> `type-intersection-whole/`: an intersection as the whole `defineProps<>` argument must resolve its props.

## Known legacy gaps (angular)

- Accepted deltas, no markers: snippets are bindings-only - no ng-content children, no banana-in-a-box for `model()`, functions and `undefined` interpolate raw.
- Every decorator input records `required: true`; compodoc never emits `optional` (#28706).
- Number-typed inputs without a literal default record an invented `NaN` default; numeric expression defaults collapse to `NaN` too.
- Non-numeric expression defaults record raw source strings (`Math.max(1, 3)`).
- JSDoc tags never reach argTypes structurally: `@deprecated` vanishes (#9721), `@see` text leaks into the description, `@default` values keep quotes and a trailing newline.
- `function`, `any`, and generic type strings collapse to `{ name: 'other', value: 'empty-enum' }`.
- Literal unions, alias unions, and TS enums all resolve to enum sbTypes at compodoc 2.0.0 - the #33779 collapse does not reproduce at this version.
- Cross-file inheritance is fully resolved (a regression baseline, not a gap).
- With `angularFilterNonInputControls` off, `properties`/`methods`/`view child` sections surface as argTypes, including private fields (#22007); on restricts to inputs.
- `model()` records one input plus a synthesized `${name}Change` output; the compodoc quirk behind that is written up in `code/lib/angular-compodoc/README.md`.
- Snippets use only the first comma-separated selector; attribute selectors are mangled to bare attributes.

## Issue-linked cases (angular)

- #28706 -> `decorator-io-basics/`: TS-optional inputs must record `required: false`. Red markers.
- #9721 -> `jsdoc-tags/`: member JSDoc tags must reach `table.jsDocTags` structurally. Red marker.
- #33779 (not reproduced) -> `decorator-union-enum/`: the reported union collapse does not occur at compodoc 2.0.0; regression baseline, no marker.
- #29697 (not reproduced) -> `signal-io/`: aliased signal inputs record under their alias at 2.0.0; regression baseline, no marker.
- #22007 -> `properties-methods-noise/`: the filter flag's origin case, and the fixture where both flag states meaningfully differ. The ACM engine closes it: `propsTable: 'api'` (its default) drops private and `#` properties and methods plus `@internal` members, while keeping `protected` members and every declared input and output, so the `acm-` baselines record fewer rows than the legacy ones on purpose.

## Known legacy gaps (svelte)

- Component descriptions are always empty; the svelte-vite docgen plugin writes `data` and `name` only, so `<!-- @component ... -->` never reaches `description.snapshot`.
  `runes-basic-props` records the end-to-end result: with no JSDoc above `defineMeta` the docs parameter is `undefined` too, where `runes-component-props-indexed` keeps the `defineMeta` JSDoc case.
- No events or slots are recorded by the docgen plugin. Legacy `createEventDispatcher` and `<slot>` declarations stay absent, and Svelte `Snippet` props record as `properties`.
- Literal unions keep raw type text in `type.name` and `table.type.summary`; literal-only unions may get `control.options`, but they do not become an `enum` sbType.
- `table.jsDocTags` is never populated. The current recordings keep only prop description text; `@deprecated`, `@default`, `@example`, and `@internal` do not leak into descriptions.
- Svelte CSF text-content `args.x` references are JSON-stringified, so `<h1>{args.title}</h1>` records as `<h1>{"Reference title"}</h1>`.
- Svelte CSF `asChild` markup is emitted verbatim; Story args do not reach the child component markup.
- Svelte CSF `{...args}` expansion emits every non-null arg, including values equal to component defaults.
- Plain CSF snippets omit `undefined` and `null`, skip action args, and render functions as `{<handler>}`; Svelte CSF renders Storybook `fn()` mocks by prepared arg key and named inline functions by name.
- `$bindable` defaults record as `"..."`, while rest props inherited from `HTMLInputAttributes` are not recorded.
- Imported interfaces are resolved only to their alias name, e.g. `PanelConfig`; object, tuple, intersection, `Record`, `Date`, and array props record as raw type text.
- JavaScript JSDoc `@type` props record names, types, required/default state, but no prop descriptions from the JSDoc object shape.
- Intrinsic props from `svelte/elements` vanish even when destructured with defaults, so `type = 'text'`, `disabled`, and `placeholder` are absent from argTypes while still appearing in snippets when passed as args or template attributes.
- Props declared both in the component's own type and in an intersected `svelte/elements` interface keep their rows but record the intersected type text, e.g. `value` from `runes-omit-rest-class` records `any` and `class` records `string | string & ClassArray | string & ClassDictionary`.
- A prop named `class` records under the literal `class` key; `ClassValue` expands to Svelte's class helper union text.
- `$bindable()` without a default records the same `"..."` default summary as `$bindable('')`.
- Indexed-access component props such as `ComponentProps<typeof Button>['variant']` collapse to `any`, while generic prop type parameters can lose type text entirely and generic tuple arrays preserve raw text such as `[Value, string, (string | undefined)?][]`.
- Legacy nullable unions drop `null`/`undefined` from the recorded type text, even when defaults such as `null` still record in `table.defaultValue.summary`.
- `$$Props` helper interfaces and template-literal index signatures do not surface as rows; only matching `export let` declarations record.
- Svelte CSF meta `render: template` stories record the root-level template source with substituted args; `defineMeta().argTypes` does not reach `extractArgTypes`, which records only component docgen output.
- Svelte CSF snippet values inside `args` render as `{snippet}`.
- Svelte CSF template attributes keep identifier values such as `footer={sharedFooter}` and drop the identifier's snippet definition.
- Svelte CSF `template={modalTemplate}` records the referenced root-level snippet source with substituted args.
- Svelte CSF nested snippet bodies substitute `args.x` references as JSON-stringified values, e.g. `{"Inline error"}`.
- String arg values containing `args.` followed by an identifier are substituted as if they were references, e.g. `'code args.open done'` records as `code true done`; a reference right before the closing quote also swallows the quote and one resolving to a string nests quotes, so such recordings are kept out of the corpus.
- Static Svelte CSF templates with no args parameter record their literal markup.

## Known legacy gaps (web-components)

- Reflected booleans record twice: once as the attribute and once as the property.
- Literal unions stay as free text, and `@deprecated` / `@default` do not reach `table.jsDocTags` structurally.
- Events record `void` as their sbType instead of structured event detail.
- Lit default-render snippets are empty because args are assigned as properties.
- Property-only Lit bindings are dropped from snippets without a warning.
- Lit event listener bindings are dropped from snippets without a warning.
- Reflected Lit attributes can be missing when the snippet is read before asynchronous reflection.
- `@summary` is recorded by the analyzer but never reaches the component description.
- Class-level `@deprecated` never reaches the component description.
- CEM 2.1.0 `cssStates` and `readonly` are ignored; the 1.0.0 and 2.1.0 recordings are identical.
- The web-component-analyzer shape is accepted with no deprecation warning, and `schemaVersion` is never read (missing and unknown versions extract identically).
- `@internal` members are stripped by the analyzer and never reach the manifest, so `lit-union-jsdoc`'s `renderCount` is a regression baseline, not a marker.
- An inline `@deprecated` inside an `@attr` description is kept as description text by the analyzer (no `deprecated` field), so `vanilla-basic`'s `legacy-label` records the tag verbatim; an analyzer limitation, not a runtime gap.
- The analyzer flattens superclass and mixin members into the tag's declaration, so `lit-inheritance-mixin/custom-elements.json` is a regression baseline; its hand-written `custom-elements.unflattened.json` keeps the members on the parents and records the legacy gap under the `unflattened-` prefix; the server baselines assert that the resolver closes it by yielding the capture's argTypes exactly, including for an undocumented override. Same-manifest references carry the package name the way `@lit-labs/analyzer` output does.
- `vanilla-multi-definition` targets only `multi-beta` correctly at this baseline version, so it is a regression baseline rather than a red marker.

## Issue-linked cases (web-components)

- SB-1893 -> server-side docgen provider registration for `@storybook/web-components`.
- SB-1894 -> Custom Elements Manifest loading for the server-side provider.

## The performance bench

`src/perf/` measures how fast the docgen engines are and how much memory they hold, which is the other half of the "docgen beyond React" question the snapshot comparator above answers for correctness.
It is a set of CLIs rather than part of this package's exported API, so nothing in `src/perf/` is re-exported from `src/index.ts`.

All commands run from `code/lib/docgen-harness`:

```bash
yarn bench:docgen-perf            # per-engine cold/warm latency and memory, full profile (~1 min)
yarn bench:docgen-perf --quick    # smoke profile; its numbers are marked non-comparable
yarn bench:docgen-perf-gate       # the same suite, plus budget assertions - what the CI gate runs
yarn bench:docgen-memory          # the docgen-server memory regression gate
```

`bench:docgen-perf` generates synthetic projects under the shared sandbox directory, runs each engine in its own child process, and writes a results JSON next to them.
The generated trees are left on disk so you can open what was measured, and each engine/scenario owns one directory that the generator wipes before it writes.
That makes two bench runs at once clobber each other - one wipes a tree the other is mid-way through reading - so run them one at a time.
`bench:docgen-memory` asserts both that re-extraction is leak-free and that the program-recycle fix still flips a tight-heap run from OOM to survival.

### Running one engine, or one that is out of the default run

```bash
yarn bench:docgen-perf --engine react-osa                       # one engine
yarn bench:docgen-perf --engine react-legacy --engine react-osa # a control pair, one invocation
yarn bench:docgen-perf --json /tmp/results.json                 # where the results land
```

The default run is `react-legacy`, `react-osa`, `vue-docgen-api`, `vue-component-meta` and `compodoc`.
Two ids sit outside it and only measure when named: `react-legacy-rdt` (the `react-docgen-typescript` parser) and `vue-component-meta-next` (the version-pair alias).
A ratio only appears when both sides of a control pair measured in the same invocation, so naming one side gives you a table row and no comparison.

Compodoc is skipped with a message when its CLI does not resolve; every other engine reads from the workspace, so a missing one is a failure rather than a skip.

### The two React shapes

The React engines run every scenario twice, because Storybook documents components in two shapes that cost very different things:

- `whole-index` - one batch over every component, what the manifest generator does.
- `first-story` - the single component a request asks for, what the docgen server does. This is the number a developer waits for before Controls populate.

The cold ratio between the React engines is 0.73 over the index and 0.08 over the first story; reading only one of them gives a misleading picture of the engine's cost.

### Comparing two releases of one engine

`vue-component-meta-next` is an alias in this package's `package.json`, pinned to an exact version.
Point it at the version you want to test, `yarn install`, then run both sides in one invocation:

```bash
yarn bench:docgen-perf --engine vue-component-meta --engine vue-component-meta-next
```

Pin the candidate exactly rather than with a range - two caret ranges can resolve to one install, and then the run compares an engine against itself.
The suite prints both resolved versions beside every ratio and calls out two equal ones as not being a comparison at all.

The mechanism is not Vue-specific: an engine entry declares which install it measures, the child imports that specifier instead of a hard-coded package, and a pair is two entries differing only in that field.
`PERF-METHODOLOGY.md` has the steps for setting one up on another engine, and the one case it does not cover.
`PERF-METHODOLOGY.md` walks through reading those guard lines, and through adding a pair for another engine.

### The gate and its budgets

Both gates run on CircleCI's daily tier, which is triggered on demand by the `ci:daily` label on a pull request - nothing schedules it, so this is not nightly protection.

`bench:docgen-perf-gate` runs the suite at the pinned profile, asserts the budgets in `src/perf/docgen-shared/budgets.ts`, and then proves its own failure detection by running a deliberately failing engine and requiring that run to come back non-zero.
It writes into the sandbox directory by default; CI passes `--out ./perf-results` so the results can be stored as a build artifact.

It refuses to report a green gate on a `--quick` run, on an empty budget table, or when a budgeted engine skipped or failed - each of those would look like protection while asserting nothing.

Budgets are ratios and absolute megabytes, never raw milliseconds, because wall clock on a shared CI executor is far too noisy to gate on.
Change one only against numbers measured on CI, and record where they came from in `PERF-METHODOLOGY.md`.

Read `src/perf/PERF-METHODOLOGY.md` before changing a metric, a budget, or a version pair.
It is the contract these numbers are only meaningful under.

The bench also carries unit tests for its own aggregation, reporting and generator logic, so `yarn test code/lib/docgen-harness` runs those alongside the fixture comparisons.

## What does not live here

- Framework provider code lives in each framework's own package.
